# üò≥ etheryal Kernel

**etheryal microkernel** is an Open Source *capability-based* Kernel written in the Rust programming language. *etheryal Kernel* uses a modular design based on Webassembly System Interface (WASI), containerizing drivers and user-space applications in a safe lightweight sandbox (WASM), without requiring slow kernel-mode to user-mode switches on every system call and interrupt, that may happen really often in common workloads. Just like [Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(operating_system)), etheryal internal security uses type safety instead of hardware memory protection.

Unlike most historic microkernels, etheryal components execute in the same address space (process), which contains software-isolated processes (SIPs). Each SIP has its own data and code layout, and is independent from other SIPs. These SIPs behave like normal processes, but avoid the cost of task-switches.

# ‚öí Building

You can build a Kernel image with just `cargo make`, but is often desireable to create a booteable image for debugging purposes. Our `bootimage` tool creates a UEFI and BIOS booteable `.img` files, that you can run in your favorite emulator or on bare-metal hardware.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/etheryal/bootimage --branch main
cargo install --force cargo-make

cargo make build-image
```

# ü•≥ Running

You can start a QEMU virtual machine running our `bootimage` with `cargo make`.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/etheryal/bootimage --branch main
cargo install --force cargo-make

cargo make run-qemu
```
